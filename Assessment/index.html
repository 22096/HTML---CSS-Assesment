      <h3>About Me :</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Uttara! And as you can see I've put my best foot forward for My Website.<br><br>
        My favourite colour is blue (as you can probaby tell). I have 3 favorite sports; Hockey, Badminton and
        Volleyball. Also in DT I'm looking Forward to learn different types of coding languages, and also I want to be
        able to finish making a Doraemon plushie that I wasn't able to make last year. (If I can that is)
        <br><br>
        At this stage I'm thinking of making a Gimp landscpe also using Inkscape - Vector graphic designs, and get cut
        out as a Background Creation. Representing things I like, for my term 4 project.
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection on Creating a Website</h3>
      <p>
        Some things I've learnt about HTML & CSS so far is that if you miss even a slash or a dot things can go very
        wrong. It's hard to find out where you've messed up but it's clear that you have. I started by adding personal
        details about myself in the form of images and other information. And so I chose the complementary colors blue,
        white and orange, as my color scheme because they stand out together and make the website look
        astonishing.<br><br>
        To be honest, at the start it was kinda hard to know or find out what should go where. But then afterwards it was gettng a bit easy easier, and halfway through I was getting different ideas of what I could add and stuff. I've tried adding an automatic slideshow, which didn't work properly at the start but I tried and tried so there it is. <br><br>
