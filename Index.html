            <h1>OM Symbol</h1>
            <p>Om is a powerful mantra, syllable, and symbol in Hinduism that embodies spiritual truth, divine energy, and the entire universe. Om is composed of three distinct syllables, A-U-M, and is said to contain all the sounds of creation. Om or aum is a sacred sound considered by many ancient philosophical texts to be the sound of the universe, encompassing all other sounds within it. In Sanskrit, om is called Pranava, which means to hum, and is considered an unlimited or eternal sound. The word Om is defined by Hindu scripture as being the primordial sound of creation. It is the original vibration of the universe. From this first vibration, all other vibrations are able to manifest. </p>

            <h1>Ram Mandir (Temple)</h1>
            <p>Ayodhya is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama. It holds immense significance for millions of devotees. The ancient city witnessed the unfolding of the epic Ramayana, a timeless narrative that transcends generations. Ayodhya Ram Mandir's history dates back to the 11th century when it was originally constructed as a dedication to Lord Rama. This temple became a revered place of worship for centuries, symbolising devotion and faith. However, things took a dramatic turn during the Mughal era in the 16th century. Many Hindus believe that it is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism. The temple was inaugurated on 22 January 2024 after a prana pratishtha (consecration) ceremony. At the heart of the temple's significance lies the belief that it stands on the spot where Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu, was born. The Ayodhya Ram Mandir becomes not just a structure but a sacred ground, revered by devotees who see it as a living connection to their beloved deity.</p>

            <h1>India's New Parliament Building</h1>
            <p>The government has said a new Parliament building was badly needed as the existing structure "is highly stressed" for a number of reasons including capacity, infrastructure, technology and safety. The need for a new Indian Parliament building was long overdue. According to government data, the old Parliament building of India, constructed in 1927, was not intended to accommodate a bicameral legislature. The seating arrangements thus became cramped and inconvenient. The new Parliament building represents a significant upgrade in capacity and modern amenities. It is designed to comfortably accommodate 888 Members of Parliament in the Lok Sabha, which is three times the capacity of the old Lok Sabha (Parliament).</p>
